# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by John Delshadi

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, 
Zinsser details two important ideas on writing well, 
simplicity and clarity. He says good writing “is stripping
every sentence to its cleanest component.” Thinking clearly
and continual rewriting are essential elements of simple 
and effective writing. If the reader has to work hard to 
understand your writing, it is not simple and clear. Clutter
is unneeded words and wordiness, a virus originally from 
politics and business. Zinsser argues that clutter can even
kill, that clutter is deception. Use concise words, “examine
every word,” clutter adds no value. Simplicity and clarity 
are critical elements of effective writing.
